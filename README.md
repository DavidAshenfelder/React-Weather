## Synopsis
This is a practice app that I learned react and a little bit of es2015. I tried to keep components as functional and stateless as possible (with the exception of my highest order component.)

## Motivation
I wanted to get familiar with how Alt.js structure worked, and I wanted to incorporate the React Drag and Drop lib into this application since it would be used in the upcoming project.

## Installation
Clone Repo > Run

`npm install
npm start`

`go to http://localhost:8080/ in your browser`

## Known Issues/Future Things-To-Do
- Search Bar Does not clear when you select city.
- Tighten up the drag and drop to have more of a dashed outline for drop zone.
